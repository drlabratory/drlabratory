 abstract = {The physiological consequences of molecular chaperone
overproduction in Escherichia coli are presented. Constitutive
overproduction of DnaK from a multicopy plasmid containing large
chromosomal fragments spanning the dnaK region resulted in
plasmid instability. Co-overproduction of DnaJ with DnaK
stabilized plasmid levels. To examine the effects of altered
levels of DnaK and DnaJ in a more specific manner, an inducible
expression system for dnaK and dnaJ was constructed and
characterized. Differential rates of DnaK synthesis were
determined by quantitative Western blot (immunoblot) analysis.
Moderate levels of DnaK overproduction resulted in a defect in
cell septation and formation of cell filaments, but
co-overproduction of DnaJ overcame this effect. Further increases
in the level of DnaK terminated culture growth despite increased
levels of DnaJ. DnaK overproduction was found to be
bacteriocidal, and this effect was also partially suppressed by
DnaJ. The bacteriocidal effect was apparent only with cultures
which were allowed to enter stationary phase, indicating that
DnaK toxicity is growth phase dependent.},
