 abstract = {Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is a pathogenic yeast and the cause
of cryptococcal meningitis. Prevalence of disease between males
and females is skewed, with males having an increased incidence
of disease. Based on the reported gender susceptibility
differences to Cn in the literature, we used clinical isolates
from Botswanan HIV-infected patients to test the hypothesis that
different gender environments exerted different selective
pressures on Cn. When we examined this data set, we found that
men had significantly higher risk of death despite having
significantly higher CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts upon admittance
to the hospital. These observations suggested that Cn strains are
uniquely adapted to different host gender environments and that
the male immune response may be less efficient in controlling Cn
infection. To discriminate between these possibilities, we tested
whether there were phenotypic differences between strains
isolated from males and females and whether there was an
interaction between Cn and the host immune response. Virulence
phenotypes showed that Cn isolates from females had longer
doubling times and released more capsular glucoronoxylomannan
(GXM). The presence of testosterone but not 17-$Î²$ estradiol
was associated with higher levels of GXM release for a laboratory
strain and 28 clinical isolates. We also measured phagocytic
efficiency, survival of Cn, and amount of killing of human
macrophages by Cn after incubation with four isolates. While
macrophages from females phagocytosed more Cn than macrophages
from males, male macrophages had a higher fungal burden and
showed increased killing by Cn. These data are consistent with
the hypothesis that differential interaction between Cn and
macrophages within different gender environments contribute to
the increased prevalence of cryptococcosis in males. This could
be related to differential expression of cryptococcal virulence
genes and capsule metabolism, changes in Cn phagocytosis and
increased death of Cn-infected macrophages.},
