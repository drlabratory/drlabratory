abstract: Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is a pathogenic yeast and the cause of cryptococcal
  meningitis. Prevalence of disease between males and females is skewed, with males
  having an increased incidence of disease. Based on the reported gender susceptibility
  differences to Cn in the literature, we used clinical isolates from Botswanan HIV-infected
  patients to test the hypothesis that different gender environments exerted different
  selective pressures on Cn. When we examined this data set, we found that men had
  significantly higher risk of death despite having significantly higher CD4(+) T
  lymphocyte counts upon admittance to the hospital. These observations suggested
  that Cn strains are uniquely adapted to different host gender environments and that
  the male immune response may be less efficient in controlling Cn infection. To discriminate
  between these possibilities, we tested whether there were phenotypic differences
  between strains isolated from males and females and whether there was an interaction
  between Cn and the host immune response. Virulence phenotypes showed that Cn isolates
  from females had longer doubling times and released more capsular glucoronoxylomannan
  (GXM). The presence of testosterone but not 17-$Î²$ estradiol was associated with
  higher levels of GXM release for a laboratory strain and 28 clinical isolates. We
  also measured phagocytic efficiency, survival of Cn, and amount of killing of human
  macrophages by Cn after incubation with four isolates. While macrophages from females
  phagocytosed more Cn than macrophages from males, male macrophages had a higher
  fungal burden and showed increased killing by Cn. These data are consistent with
  the hypothesis that differential interaction between Cn and macrophages within different
  gender environments contribute to the increased prevalence of cryptococcosis in
  males. This could be related to differential expression of cryptococcal virulence
  genes and capsule metabolism, changes in Cn phagocytosis and increased death of
  Cn-infected macrophages.
