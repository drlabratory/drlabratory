abstract: 'We have investigated a large set of interactions from the Helicobacter
  pylori protein interaction map previously identified by high-throughput yeast two-hybrid
  (htY2H)-based methods. This study had two aims: i) to validate htY2H as a source
  of protein-protein interaction complexes for high-throughput biochemical and structural
  studies of the H. pylori interactome; and ii) to validate biochemically interactions
  shown by htY2H to involve components of the H. pylori type IV secretion systems.
  Thus, 17 interactions involving 31 proteins and protein fragments were studied,
  and a general strategy was designed to produce protein-interacting partners for
  biochemical and structural characterization. We show that htY2H is a valid source
  of protein-protein complexes for high-throughput proteome-scale characterization
  of the H. pylori interactome, because 76% of the interactions tested were confirmed
  biochemically. Of the interactions involving type IV secretion proteins, three could
  be confirmed. One interaction is between two components of the type IV secretion
  apparatus, ComB10 and ComB4, which are VirB10 and VirB4 homologs, respectively.
  Another interaction is between a type IV component (HP0525, a VirB11 homolog) and
  a non-type IV secretion protein (HP01451), indicating that proteins other than the
  core VirB (1-11)-VirD4 proteins may play a role in type IV secretion. Finally, a
  third interaction was biochemically confirmed between CagA, a virulence factor secreted
  by the type IV secretion system encoded by the Cag pathogenicity island, and a non-type
  IV secretion protein, HP0496.'
