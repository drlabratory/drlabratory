abstract: Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible
  for serious meningitis. Although many useful molecular tools have been developed
  for its study, there are currently few inducible promoters available for general
  use. To address this need, we have constructed expression plasmids incorporating
  upstream elements of the C. neoformans copper transporter gene CTR4, and tested
  them in C. neoformans serotypes A and D. In response to copper deprivation, these
  plasmids mediate high-level expression of a reporter protein. This expression can
  be completely repressed using physiologically low concentrations of copper. Notably,
  this new family of copper-sensing promoters demonstrates excellent expression in
  serotype A, contrasting with other available promoters. These plasmids therefore
  offer efficient and regulated expression for both serotypes A and D, and should
  be valuable tools for the C. neoformans research community.
