 abstract = {Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen
responsible for serious meningitis. Although many useful
molecular tools have been developed for its study, there are
currently few inducible promoters available for general use. To
address this need, we have constructed expression plasmids
incorporating upstream elements of the C. neoformans copper
transporter gene CTR4, and tested them in C. neoformans serotypes
A and D. In response to copper deprivation, these plasmids
mediate high-level expression of a reporter protein. This
expression can be completely repressed using physiologically low
concentrations of copper. Notably, this new family of
copper-sensing promoters demonstrates excellent expression in
serotype A, contrasting with other available promoters. These
plasmids therefore offer efficient and regulated expression for
both serotypes A and D, and should be valuable tools for the C.
