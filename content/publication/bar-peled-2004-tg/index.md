abstract: UDP-glucose dehydrogenase catalyses the conversion of UDP-glucose into UDP-GlcA,
  a critical precursor for glycan synthesis across evolution. We have cloned the gene
  encoding this important enzyme from the opportunistic pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans.
  In this fungus, UDP-GlcA is required for the synthesis of capsule polysaccharides,
  which in turn are essential for virulence. The gene was expressed in Escherichia
  coli and the 51.3-kDa recombinant protein from wild-type and five mutants was purified
  for analysis. The cryptococcal enzyme is strongly inhibited by UDP-xylose and NADH,
  has highest activity at pH 7.5 and demonstrates Km (app) values of 0.1 and 1.5 mM
  for NAD+ and UDP-glucose respectively. Its activity was significantly decreased
  by mutations in the putative sites of NAD+ and UDP-glucose binding. Unlike previously
  reported eukaryotic UDP-glucose dehydrogenases, which are hexamers, the cryptococcal
  enzyme is a dimer.
