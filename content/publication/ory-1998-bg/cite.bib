 abstract = {Adipocyte lipid-binding protein (ALBP) is a small (14.5 kDa)
10-stranded beta-barrel protein found in mammalian fat cells. The
crystal structures of various holo-forms of ALBP have been solved
and show the fatty acid ligand bound in a large (approximately
400 A3) cavity isolated from bulk solvent. Examination of the
cavity suggests that it would be a good site for the creation of
an artificial catalyst, as numerous well defined crystal
structures of ALBP are available and past studies have shown the
conformation to be reasonably tolerant to modification and
mutagenesis. Previous work has shown ALBP to be a good protein
scaffold for exploring enantio- and stereoselective reactions;
two constructs, ALBP attached to either a pyridoxamine or a
phenanthroline group at C117, have been chemically characterized.
Both modified proteins have been crystallized and their
structures solved and refined. The X-ray models have been used to
examine the origin of the chiral selectivity seen in the
products. It is apparent that these covalent adducts reduce the
internal cavity volume, sterically limiting substrate
interactions with the reactive groups, as well as solvent access
to potential intermediates in the reaction pathway.},
