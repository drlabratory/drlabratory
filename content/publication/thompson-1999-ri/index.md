abstract: The crystal and solution structures of all of the intracellular lipid binding
  proteins (iLBPs) reveal a common beta-barrel framework with only small local perturbations.
  All existing evidence points to the binding cavity and a poorly delimited 'portal'
  region as defining the function of each family member. The importance of local structure
  within the cavity appears to be its influence on binding affinity and specificity
  for the lipid. The portal region appears to be involved in the regulation of ligand
  exchange. Within the iLBP family, liver fatty acid binding protein or LFABP, has
  the unique property of binding two fatty acids within its internalized binding cavity
  rather than the commonly observed stoichiometry of one. Furthermore, LFABP will
  bind hydrophobic molecules larger than the ligands which will associate with other
  iLBPs. The crystal structure of LFABP contains two bound oleate molecules and provides
  the explanation for its unusual stoichiometry. One of the bound fatty acids is completely
  internalized and has its carboxylate interacting with an arginine and two serines.
  The second oleate represents an entirely new binding mode with the carboxylate on
  the surface of LFABP. The two oleates also interact with each other. Because of
  this interaction and its inner location, it appears the first oleate must be present
  before the second more external molecule is bound.
