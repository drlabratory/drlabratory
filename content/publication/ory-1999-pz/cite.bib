 abstract = {The fluorescent probe anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate binds to
adipocyte lipid binding protein at a site that competes with
normal physiological ligands, such as fatty acids. Binding to the
protein is accompanied by a relatively large increase in
fluorescent intensity. To correlate the major change in optical
properties and to determine the mechanism of competitive
inhibition with fatty acids, the crystal structure of the protein
with the bound fluorophore has been determined. In addition, the
thermodynamic contributions to the binding reaction have been
studied by titration calorimetry. Because the binding site is in
a relatively internal position, kinetic studies have also been
carried out to determine k(on). The results indicate that binding
is not accompanied by any major conformational change. However,
the negatively charged sulfonate moiety is not positioned the
same as the carboxylate of fatty acid ligands as determined in
previous studies. Nonetheless, the binding reaction is still
driven by enthalpic effects. As judged by the crystallographic
structure, a significant amount of the surface of the fluorophore
is no longer exposed to water in the bound state.},
