abstract: Rhodotorula yeasts are pink, encapsulated basidiomycetes isolated from a
  variety of environments and clinical settings. They are increasingly linked with
  disease, particularly central venous catheter infections and meningitis, in immunocompromised
  patients. Eight clinical and eight environmental strains molecularly typed as Rhodotorula
  mucilaginosa were compared to six Cryptococcus neoformans strains for phenotypic
  variability. Growth on cell integrity-challenging media suggested that R. mucilaginosa
  cells possess differences in signaling pathways, cell wall composition, or assembly
  and that their membranes are more susceptible to perturbations than those of C.
  neoformans All 16 R. mucilaginosa strains produced urease, while none produced melanin
  with l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) as a substrate. India ink staining reveals
  that clinical R. mucilaginosa capsules are larger than environmental capsules but
  that both are generally smaller than C. neoformans capsules. All R. mucilaginosa
  strains were resistant to fluconazole. Only two clinical strains were susceptible
  to voriconazole; all of the environmental strains were resistant. We generated an
  anticapsular antibody (Rh1) to R. mucilaginosa; Rh1 did not bind C. neoformans control
  strains, was specific to Rhodotorula species, and bound to all tested Rhodotorula
  strains. Binding assays performed with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), concanavalin
  A (ConA), calcofluor white (CFW), and eosin Y dye (EY) cell surface probes suggested
  that chitin may be more accessible in R. mucilaginosa but that the total abundance
  of chitooligomers is less than in C. neoformans This report describes a novel reagent
  that can be used to identify Rhodotorula species and lays the foundation for future
  cell envelope composition analysis.IMPORTANCE Currently, there is very little known
  about the phenotypic variability within species of Rhodotorula strains and the role
  of their capsule. Cryptococcus neoformans has been considered the only encapsulated
  human fungal pathogen, but as more individuals come to live in states of immunocompromised
  health, they are more susceptible to fungal infections, including those by RhodotorulaR.
  mucilaginosa species are some of those most commonly associated with clinical infections.
  We wanted to know if clinical and environmental strains of R. mucilaginosa demonstrated
  disparate capsule phenotypes. With limited antifungal options available and clinical
  Rhodotorula spp. often resistant to common antifungal drugs such as fluconazole,
  caspofungin (1, 2), and voriconazole (2), a better understanding of the fungal biology
  could inform the design and use of future antifungal drugs. The generation of an
  antibody specific to Rhodotorula fungi could be a useful diagnostic tool, and this
  work presents the first mention of such in the literature.
