 abstract = {The Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB; wwpdb.org) is the
international collaboration that manages the deposition,
processing and distribution of the PDB archive. The online PDB
archive at ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org is the repository for the
coordinates and related information for more than 47 000
structures, including proteins, nucleic acids and large
macromolecular complexes that have been determined using X-ray
crystallography, NMR and electron microscopy techniques. The
members of the wwPDB-RCSB PDB (USA), MSD-EBI (Europe), PDBj
(Japan) and BMRB (USA)-have remediated this archive to address
inconsistencies that have been introduced over the years. The
scope and methods used in this project are presented.},
