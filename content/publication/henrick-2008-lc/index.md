abstract: The Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB; wwpdb.org) is the international
  collaboration that manages the deposition, processing and distribution of the PDB
  archive. The online PDB archive at ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org is the repository for the
  coordinates and related information for more than 47 000 structures, including proteins,
  nucleic acids and large macromolecular complexes that have been determined using
  X-ray crystallography, NMR and electron microscopy techniques. The members of the
  wwPDB-RCSB PDB (USA), MSD-EBI (Europe), PDBj (Japan) and BMRB (USA)-have remediated
  this archive to address inconsistencies that have been introduced over the years.
  The scope and methods used in this project are presented.
